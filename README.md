# ScrollCells

This is a demonstration of iOS table view cells that can be swiped/scrolled horizontally to reveal contextual controls. Since iOS 7, this is similar to the built-in swipe-to-delete behaviour, but using your own scroll view provides far more flexibility. Before iOS 7, scroll views were rarely used for this common user interaction pattern: instead swipe gesture recognisers were used. Their discrete action removed the feeling of direct interaction.

## Status

Last tested with Xcode 5.1.1 and the iOS 7.1 SDK.

Currently, only the visual aspects of this interaction design are demonstrated. There is no suggestion of how to respond to button taps from contextual controls.
